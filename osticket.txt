Hello team, in the tutorial below, we will guide you through the installation of osTicket on XAMPP 8.1. This version of XAMPP includes PHP 8.1 and MySQL 8.0, which are the recommended versions for installing osTicket 1.18. The installation and configuration process is straightforward.

osTicket is a ticketing system designed to efficiently manage customer support inquiries for organizations. It offers various features such as ticket management, email integration, ticket queues and assignments, a knowledge base, customizable ticket forms, ticket filters and escalation, collaboration through internal notes, reporting and analytics, multilingual support, and extensibility through plugins and extensions. These features allow businesses to centralize their support operations, improve customer communication, track performance metrics, and resolve customer issues effectively.

Installation of osTicket:
1. Start by installing XAMPP 8.1. During installation, create a folder named "xampp-8.1" if you have another version of XAMPP installed. If you already have XAMPP or Alfresco running, ensure you change the port numbers before starting Apache or MySQL.
2. Download the "osticket" folder and extract it. Place the "upload" folder in the "xamp/htdocs/osticket" directory along with the script folder.
3. Set a password for MySQL on the command prompt using the following steps:
   a. Open xampp control panel, then shelll and enter the command: mysql -h localhost -u root -p
   b. When prompted, enter the password for the "root" user (press enter if you have no password).
   c. Execute the following command to set the password: SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('yourpassword');
4. Open the "config.inc.php" file located in "/xampp/phpmyadmin/" and make the following modifications:
   a. Modify the following lines to set the authentication type and information:
      $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'cookie';
      $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = 'root';
      $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'yourpassword';
      $cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension'] = 'mysqli';
      $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = false;
      $cfg['Lang'] = '';

      After logging into the database, create a database named "osticket" (failure to create this will result in an error during installation).
5. Locate your "php.ini" file (e.g., C:/xampp/php/php.ini).
6. If any of the following extensions are available, enable them by removing the semicolon(;)
   - extension=imap
   - extension=intl
   - extension=opcache
7. Open "php.ini" and add the following line at the end of the file: zend_extension=php_opcache.dll
8. Rename "ost-sampleconfig.php" to "ost-config.php" in the same directory (e.g., C:\xampp-8.4\htdocs\osticket).
9. Navigate to the directory "C:\xampp-8.4\htdocs\osticket" and execute the PowerShell command "icacls include\ost-config.php /reset". This grants permission to osTicket.
To give write permission for the os-config.php file, go to the file, right click, then to security and and set the permissions as read only
10. Start XAMPP and launch osTicket to begin the installation process.
